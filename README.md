# Ex4CDS - Textual Explanations for Clinical Decision Support 

Ex4CDS are explanations (or more precisely justifications) of physicians in the context of clinical decision support. In the course of a larger study, physicians estimated the probability of different clinical outcomes in nephology, namely rejection, graft loss and infections, within the next 90 days. Each estimation had to be justified within a short text - these are our explanations. The explanations were provided in German and have strong similarities to general clinical notes. Our dataset tries to make the following contributions:

1) We analyse how humans would provide an explanation/justification for the prediction of clinical outcomes. Using this analysis, we hope to provide useful insights for future explainable automatic decision support systems - with explanations in the form of natural language.

2) As the explanations have very strong similarities to clinical text, the annotated text could be used as a useful resource in the context of (German) clinical text processing, covering for instance named entities, relations, negations, temporal information and other aspects.
